1. Identify high-performing employees (those with a performance score of 'Exceeds' or 'Fully Meets') 
	and calculate their average salary, grouped by department and gender.

2. Provide a list of active employees' tenure and determine their current employment status. 
	This should include EmployeeID, Employee Name, Department, Date of Hire, 
	Employee Status, and Tenure, ordered by higher tenure.

3. Provide the number of employees and then group them by their recruitment source. 

4. Use SQL queries to calculate Racial Diversity and Gender Diversity metrics for each recruiting source, 
	including the total number of employees, the count of female and male employees, 
	and the count of employees from different racial backgrounds.
